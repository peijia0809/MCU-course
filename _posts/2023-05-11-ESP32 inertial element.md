## Smart lighting

### 應用功能說明
•	Smart lighting will become more prevalent, with lights that can be controlled via an app on your smartphone. You will be able to adjust the brightness, color, and even schedule when the lights turn on and off.
o	Smart lights can be installed in various places in the home, such as living room, room, kitchen, etc. With the installation of smart lights, we can directly use the app on the mobile phone or tablet to control the brightness, color, and switch of the lights without going to press the switch, which is very convenient. It may also be used in other home appliances in the future, such as controlling the air-conditioning switch and temperature adjustment with the app in the mobile phone


### 設計考量與相關技術
**系統設計考量：**<br>
When designing smart lighting systems, there are several considerations that need to be taken into account, including:
1.	Purpose: The first consideration when designing smart lighting is the purpose of the lighting. Is it for general illumination, task lighting, or accent lighting? This will help determine the type and number of fixtures required.
2.	Space: The size and layout of the space will also play a significant role in determining the type and number of fixtures required. Additionally, the placement of the fixtures should be carefully considered to ensure even illumination.
3.	Energy Efficiency: Smart lighting systems are designed to be energy efficient, and therefore, the type of lighting fixtures and bulbs used should be chosen with energy efficiency in mind.
4.	Control Systems: Smart lighting systems require advanced control systems that allow the user to adjust the lighting levels and color temperature. These control systems can be integrated into the lighting fixtures or can be installed separately.
5.	User Experience: The user experience is critical when designing smart lighting systems. The lighting should be easy to control, and the controls should be intuitive and accessible.
When it comes to relevant technologies required for smart lighting design, the following are essential:
1.	LED Lighting: LED lighting is highly efficient and is a popular choice for smart lighting systems.
2.	Sensors: Sensors, such as occupancy sensors and daylight sensors, are used to detect when a space is occupied and when natural light is available. This information is used to adjust the lighting levels accordingly.
3.	Smart Controllers: Smart controllers are used to manage the lighting system, including adjusting the lighting levels and color temperature. These controllers can be integrated into the lighting fixtures or installed separately.
4.	Wireless Communication: Smart lighting systems rely on wireless communication to transmit data between the lighting fixtures and control systems. This communication can be done using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Zigbee protocols.
5.	Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence can be used to analyze data collected by sensors and control systems to optimize the lighting levels and color temperature automatically.
Overall, when designing smart lighting systems, it's essential to consider the purpose of the lighting, the space, energy efficiency, control systems, and user experience. Additionally, selecting the right technology, such as LED lighting, sensors, smart controllers, wireless communication, and artificial intelligence, is critical to achieving an effective and efficient smart lighting system.
